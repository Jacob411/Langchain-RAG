**AI ChatBot Project**
======================

**Overview**
------------

This project aims to develop an AI chatbot that can provide accurate and up-to-date information to users, specifically targeting the Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP). The chatbot
will be designed to handle common questions and reduce wasted time and resources due to frequent emails and phone calls.

**Goals**
--------

* Create an up-to-date and accurate chatbot that saves OSP time
* Improve user experience through accurate and relevant responses
* Reduce waste by minimizing email and phone inquiries

**Methodology**
--------------

We employed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining the strengths of both fine-tuning and RAG. This method allows for efficient use of resources while maintaining
high accuracy.

**Implementation**
-----------------

The project involved several key steps:

1. **Initial Sponsor Meeting**: Held an initial meeting with OSP to discuss objectives and vision.
2. **Team Update Meetings**: Conducted regular meetings with team members to review progress, discuss next steps, and assign action items.
3. **Report Finalization**: Finalized the written report and discussed next steps with the senior design group.

**Code**
------

The project code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/Jacob411/Langchain-RAG

**Commit Summary**
-----------------

A summary of key commits can be found in the commit log, including updates to document loading, Ollama chat integration, and OpenAI API usage.

**Test Environment**
-------------------

Testing will be conducted on various devices (computers, tablets, phones) across different brands to ensure versatility. Test cases will include specific scenarios, expected inputs,
and expected outputs.

**Management Plan/Meeting Minutes**
------------------------------------

A detailed management plan and meeting minutes are available for review.
